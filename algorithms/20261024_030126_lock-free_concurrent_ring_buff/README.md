# Lock-Free Concurrent Ring Buffer Data Structure in Zig

An in-memory reference implementation of **Lock-Free Concurrent Ring Buffer Data Structure** in **Zig**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Low-Latency Systems & Memory Layout`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Contiguous Memory Buffer & Ring Pointers`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Invariant Integrity**: Execution behavior is validated against nominal workflows and boundary edge cases.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(1)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N) bounded` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
zig run main.zig
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `Lock-Free Concurrent Ring Buffer Data Structure` in `Zig`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
