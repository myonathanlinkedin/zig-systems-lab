# Dijkstra Shortest Path with Fibonacci Heap Priority Queue

Self-contained **Dijkstra Shortest Path with Fibonacci Heap Priority Queue** algorithmic primitive written in idiomatic **Zig**. Built from scratch using standard library constructs with zero external dependencies.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Design Decisions

This module organizes `Dijkstra Shortest Path with Fibonacci Heap Priority Queue` into an isolated, self-contained unit:
* **Domain Focus**: `Graph Topology & Traversal`
* **Primary Primitives**: `Adjacency List & Priority Heap`
* **Memory Strategy**: Contiguous memory layouts and standard collections are favored for straightforward iteration and access.
* **Correctness Model**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

### Asymptotic Complexity

| Metric | Bound | Characteristics |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Best Case Time** | `O(V + E)` | Optimized fast-path execution |
| **Average / Worst Time** | `O((V + E) log V)` | Deterministic upper bound for generalized workloads |
| **Space Complexity** | `O(V + E)` | Strict bounds without unconstrained heap growth |

## 🧪 Verification Suite

The accompanying `main.zig` driver executes self-contained verification tests:
1. **Nominal Flow**: Validates baseline correctness under typical real-world inputs.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Exercises extreme edge cases (empty inputs, singletons, capacity limits).
3. **Invariant Preservation**: Validates internal state consistency throughout mutation lifecycles.

### Running Locally

```bash
zig run main.zig
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `Dijkstra Shortest Path with Fibonacci Heap Priority Queue` in `Zig`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
